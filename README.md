Images of Stars to be used as a training set for a star image classifier

## what?

This is a collection of PNG images of stars captured from various parts of the sky. They were captured with inexpensive astronomy video cameras.

Each image is a 20x20 pixel PNG image in colour, no post processing as done during the slicing of the images, however, some post-processing was probably done in the _capture_ of the images.
